-new methods should be tested

- in answered_question make it so that if a user tries to answer a question twice (question_id + user_id) update it. Might change the pk to composite

- implement searching by tag and show a user info (in user info screen, have compability score)

LONGER TERM

-create simple pages, /login /landing /profile

[X]-using spring security and only make /landing and /login accesible without login, get user information from db

-make so /profile gets the user entity, populates the form and allows user to update it

-implement /swipe, /searchtags

-use bootstrap, tailwind and similiar projects for makeup (im not experienced on this one)

-put locaiton back to user
