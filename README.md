# personal-dating-webapp

A simple dating webapp similiar to likes of Tinder/Okcupid, developed to prove myself a single developer can pretty much implement a fully usable product from the ground up thanks to powerful tools that didn't existed before.

Not only that but also serves as my personal testing ground for technologies I want to learn.

Currently only REST is available for testing, Postman file available on root folder.

<h2>Available features so far</h2>
-Creating users and encoding their passwords with Bcrypt\
-Users being able to specify their genders and which gender they're looking for\
-Users being able to answer questions, easily see which questions they haven't answered and specify how much the answer matters for them (Okcupid feature)\
-Users being able to tag themselves and see non-chosen tags easily

<h2>Will be added very soon</h2>
-Add more attributes and also preferences to a user, such as height, body type, horoscope\
-Searching people based on tags, like old okcupid\
-Calculating a compability score, using answered questions and tags\
-Add simple html pages

<h3>Not likely to be added soon</h3>
-Location\
-Pictures\
-Angular interface using the already developed REST part, since I'm not a frontend guy
