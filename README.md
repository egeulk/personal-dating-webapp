# personal-dating-webapp

A simple dating webapp similiar to likes of Tinder/Okcupid, developed to prove myself a single developer can pretty much implement a fully usable product from the ground up thanks to powerful tools that didn't existed before.

Not only that but also serves as my personal testing ground for technologies I want to learn.

Currently only REST is available for testing, but will add html pages thanks to thymeleaf, and will probably add a js framework that makes use of the previously implemented rest service.
